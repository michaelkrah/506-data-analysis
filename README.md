# 506-data-analysis
Final project for 506


Proposal (Due 02/10)
The project proposal should include the following:

# Overview:
Our project is a predictive tool that will predict the ratings of future movies based on budget, release date, genre, director, actors, and other factors that would be available before a movie releases. Then, users will be to use the model to predict ratings for upcoming movies to see if they should be interested in watching them. 

# Goals:
To successfully predict the rating of a movie on letterboxd based on factors that would be available before a movie is released.

# Data Collection :
We plan to create a dataset using letterboxd's api and webscraping.

# Data Modelling: 
We plan on testing a series of different methods for modeling the data to see what is most accurate.

# Data visualization:
We can compare the ratings of movie based on individual factors, such as budget or release time to see if any there are any trends we can use to predict rating.

# Testing: 
Our test plan is to train on data from before a specific cutoff date and then predict the ratings of movies after that.
