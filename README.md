# 506-data-analysis
Final project for 506


Proposal (Due 02/10)
The project proposal should include the following:

# Description of the project:
Our project is a predictive tool that will predict the ratings of future movies based on budget, release date, genre, director, actors, and other factors that would be available before a movie releases. Then, users will be to use the model to predict ratings for upcoming movies to see if they should be interested in watching them. 

# Clear goal(s):
To successfully predict the rating of a movie on letterboxd based on factors that would be available before a movie is released.

# What data needs to be collected:
We plan to create a dataset using letterboxd's api and webscraping.

# How you plan on modeling the data: 
We plan on testing a series of different methods for modeling the data to see what is most accurate.

# How do you plan on visualizing the data:


# What is your test plan? 
Our test plan is to train on data from before a specific cutoff date and then predict the ratings of movies after that.
